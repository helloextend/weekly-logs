# Weekly Logs

Inspired by Gleb Bahmutov's [What I Have Done](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/what-i-have-done/)

This repo contains my weekly highlights [2021](./2021) in Markdown format.
I keep a  log of things I have done for myself (almost as a personal quick memory cache), and for daily agile stand ups at [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/s/work/p0Chzm5hUMTbc9sX)

## Task counts

The script [src/index.js](src/index.js) parses the markdown files and generates totals.

```shell
npm install
npm run count
```

See [counted.md](counted.md) file for month by month totals and averages. You can also use [counted.csv](counted.csv) or [counted.json](counted.json).
