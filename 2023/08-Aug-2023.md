* [prod-read-serverless](https://github.com/muratkeremozcan/prod-ready-serverless) Yan Cui's workshop @learning

* [Testing Email-Based Authentication Systems with Cypress, Mailosaur and cypress-data-session](https://dev.to/muratkeremozcan/testing-email-based-authentication-systems-with-cypress-mailosaur-and-cypress-data-session-j12) @blog

* Cypress vite plugin 1.0.1 deep dive - figured out a major blocker for Cypress trying to get Vite working with esmodule stubbing. Unblocks all tests that use cy.stub with Vite at Extend. This helped towards the [resolution of the issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27461). @testing 

  > We have been working with Lachlan on and off regarding stubbing esmodules while using Vite. Suffice to say, we need further help.
  >
  > Vite is the only way forward with Extend, but we need to be able to use cy.stub. Using webpack, the initial start takes over 2 minutes , saving tests or switching is also a drag, 5-10 seconds sometimes. Cypress is non-usable with webpack in our setup, because we do too many fakerJs things to generate data. We are so invested in test utilities that converting them to json and using them as cypress fixtures is a no go, simply because we customize the object generators with function arguments.

  > I made some progress diagnosing the vite-plugin-cypress 1.0.1 issue that Mike Plummer worked on, but I hit a wall at the end. Maybe this will give some ideas towards a resolution...

  > The first thing that makes it work is adding the importOnIgnoreList function back into the plugin.
  > That actually makes the weird error about ClaimsSource go away, but esmodules are not stubbed still.

  > Then I realized the ignoreList now has to be an array now, that should work better with plugin version 1.0.1.
  >
  > It seemed to be giving errors related to imports from monorepo folders, so I just kept ignoring them. Interestingly, packages did not ignore all of the packages folder and I had to hard-code it. Perhaps this can be enhanced on the plugin side?
